        "review_text": "Honestly?\nAmongst ALL the MANY Coursera courses I started, completed or abandoned over the years, this relatively short course by Professor Christos from Heriot-Watt University is a Gem!\n\nWhile Coursera's AI powered auto-grader is not perfect(..) and some small typos here and there can happen, there is ZERO fluff and filler-content! (And no actors reading a prompt..)\n\nThe readings and videos show, teach and explain new concepts and topics very well and the non-graded and graded coding assignments and quizzes are actually useful and make you think!\n\nI am truly excited to start the full \"Programming and Program Design\" course in September and honestly wish, I could start earlier and continue just where this course \"teaser\" ends! :-)\n\nDelightfully,\n\nMaximilian Frisch",
