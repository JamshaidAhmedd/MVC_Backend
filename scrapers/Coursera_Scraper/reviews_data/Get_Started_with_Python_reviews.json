The reason is that the lectures emphasize on the basics of data structure but the questions of the same lectures of much higher difficulty and doesn't even explain the relevant functions / techniques and such strategy leaves students like me to be frustrated & disappointed.\n\nSo, please if the questions (especially the dictionary & tuples) ones bound to be difficult then share the relevant techniques in the lectures before prompting us to do the exercises.",

Professional presentation is certainly important, but you end up diluting the course by including so much of this material. Furthermore, having worked on many projects, I can tell you that the workflow process is so iterative that trying to \"shoe horn\" the process into a four letter acronym -- which is better than the six letter acronym in the previous specialization -- is both reductionistic and frankly artificial.  My suggestions are as follows: remove this excess material and \"re-factor\" the PACE/portfolio material into one course, perhaps the capstone course. Otherwise, I learned quite a bit.",

Take your time, review the course material, take regular breaks to realign your mindset and most importantly - practice, practice, practice.",

By viewing content, courses 4 - 6 are advanced Python analysis, such as Introduction to Machine Learning and Regression Analysis. \n\nLet's start talking about courses 2 and 3. They throw you everything, and you must figure it out alone. It's just like you haven't learned Allegra yet, and they throw you calculus staff. How can you learn how to run if you don't know how to walk? It feels like impossible. If you have no previous Python experience, don't take this course! It will keep and keep confusing you. \n\nLet's have an example by looking at course content. In course 3, they taught you data analysis, visualization, and data cleaning afterward. This does not make any sense. If you aren't familiar with data analysis yet, data analysis should follow the steps in order(the steps might differ, but the structure is the same): Ask questions, data collect, data clean, analyze, and visualize. They don't teach in order, which is ridiculous, in my opinion. \n\nI learned content similar to this course about two years ago and recently re-picked it up for review. But for sure, if you have yet to gain experience with Python, don't take this course; find something better, I promise. At least, it confused me more.",
