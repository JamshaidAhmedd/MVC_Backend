        "review_text": "Fantastic! For anyone who is just starting out in the world of web development, this is the perfect course. Very complete introduction to HTML and CSS, a little less in Javascript, which is understandable because otherwise the course would be very long. In addition, each unit is accompanied by practice labs, and code examples very well explained by Professor Krieglstein. I am totally satisfied with everything I learned.",
