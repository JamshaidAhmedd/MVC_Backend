Quiz questions are just there for the sake of being there since they have nothing to do with Kali.\n\nContent of the course is just basics of how Linux Command Line works. Course being called \"Kali Linux\" feels like a cheap scam to grab peoples attention since it covers nothing specific to Kali",
