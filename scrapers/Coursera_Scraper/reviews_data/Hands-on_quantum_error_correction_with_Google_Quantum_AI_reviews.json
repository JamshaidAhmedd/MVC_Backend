I would not recommend this course to a beginner with no experience in quantum computing because its pretty technical. However, it is well constructed and very informative. I will take it again to grasp the concepts even more.",

This course presents a first-of-its-kind coherent, concise and logically progressing explanation of stabilizers, the surface code, decoding and everything related to QEC. As an upcoming researcher in QEC, this course has been invaluable for solidifying my fundamentals in this field.",
