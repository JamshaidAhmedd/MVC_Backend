It provided a great blend of advanced data structures and cryptography concepts, especially RSA, along with an introductory view into quantum algorithms. The explanations were clear, and the examples helped in understanding even the complex topics like GCD, Bezout\u2019s Identity, and RSA's mathematical foundation. The part on quantum computing sparked a lot of curiosity\u2014it\u2019s complex but exciting! Definitely recommended for anyone interested in both classical and modern algorithmic techniques.",
