        "review_text": "The positive aspects of this course is the technical depth. The course covers a range of key topics in quantum information from quantum gates, entanglement, quantum channels, and measurements. The materials fit a first semester graduate course on the topic.\nHowever, I believe this course is poorly structured. First of all, the lecture videos are very jargon heavy and often new terms and concepts are introduced without any definition. The instructor is often unclear about a step and hand waves details when showing a proof or explanation. There is little to no time dedicated to motivation for certain topics. I found the videos only useful when used as a secondary source with a textbook such as \u201cQuantum Computation and Quantum Information\u201d by Nielsen and Chuang. (Which by the way is something I found on my own as there is no additional resources recommended by the course).\nThe assignments and the one exam are all multiple choice based and no explanation is given on the correct answer. While the problems are interesting, the majority are geared towards determining if you\u2019ve watched the videos and recall certain statements or steps. Very rarely does it synthesize multiple topics together to gauge a deeper understanding of the concepts. Overall, each assignment can be completed in at most half an hour.\nOverall my recommendation is to use the topics selected by the instructor as a guide to learn the topic from another source. I think that the topics are important but I do not think a student who is not already somewhat familiar with the topics will learn much from this course.",

Found this to be useful to introduce deeper topics to me and push me to work out problems to learn some of these concepts. \nWould have been nicer if Dr Bae could provide some reference answers or help in the forums as I'm still not confident that my understanding of problems was correct even though I passed the quizzes.",
