The final course (course 5) is a  course by someone who has not been lecturing in the course, presenting  something they obviously are very fond of. The course work is, and I  quote, \"a project with minimal scaffolding. Expect to use the the  discussion forums to gain insights! It\u2019s not cheating to ask others for  opinions or perspectives\". In other words, part of the learning target  is to work through bad or incomplete documentation and to solve an  exercise that is stated without providing the information you need to  solve it. Unless someone else already went through the moves, the  lecturer fully expects you to fail by yourself. \nIf I wanted to feel the pain of learning without help or instructions, I would have just worked with the online manuals ... which is what this exercise openly tells you they want you to do. Its a shame for the other 4 courses, which are well done and have passionate lecturers.",

I would say that this course has taught me many new and basic things that were missing in Python fir Everybody specialisation.",
