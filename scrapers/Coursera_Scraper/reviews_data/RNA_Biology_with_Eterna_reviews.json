        "review_text": "I recently explored RNA Biology with Eterna, and I found it to be an intriguing experience. The game provides an interactive way to learn about RNA biology through puzzle-solving, which is both educational and engaging. The scientific accuracy of the content is commendable, as it introduces complex biological concepts in a way that's accessible to players of all levels.\nThe puzzles are challenging yet rewarding, and the integration of real-world scientific research into gameplay adds an extra layer of depth. However, I feel that some areas could use more guidance, especially for beginners who may not be familiar with molecular biology.\nOverall, I appreciate the innovative approach Eterna takes to educate players, and it\u2019s a great resource for those interested in RNA biology. It could benefit from a bit more user-friendly tutorials, but it's a great way to engage with science in a fun and meaningful way.",

        "review_text": "Great for beginners, though some parts seem to be impossible to walk through without additional knowledge sources. Some Eterna puzzles are too complicated, and I gave up (pseudo knots, for instance), but it is a great way to understand 3D structure. Overall, I highly recommend this course for those who are interested in RNA mechanics.",
