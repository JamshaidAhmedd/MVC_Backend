I was struck by the details about the study of bioluminescence and biofluorescence by mr. Sparks, the incredible data about larvaceans that Kakani Katija received. I especially love the awe with which Jeremy Goldbogen and David Cade study whales. And of course other scientists, they're all just amazing! I love this course, and anybody else, who's interested in marine biology gonna love it too.",

I love that general principles are nicely described here, such as the chapter on water from a physical perspective, and at the same time there are plenty of specific studies, like the research on the shells of the Copelata group. The references for learning more about each chapter are also great. I really enjoyed learning new things about such a fantastic topic! If a continuation of the course comes out, I'll be on it right away!",
