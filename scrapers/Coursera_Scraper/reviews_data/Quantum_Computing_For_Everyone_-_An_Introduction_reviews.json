The rest of the course is repetitive, one video is included twice lol, and extremely hard to understand due to ESL presenters.",

Also as the name suggests, Quantum computing for everyone should be taught in a more layman language. But it looks like since the instructor is reading from a prompter or something, he just gives sentences without trying to explain it in a more layman language like with some examples.",
