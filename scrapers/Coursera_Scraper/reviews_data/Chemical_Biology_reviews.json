        "review_text": "As a former instructor of these topics, I was excited to start this course and catch up on what is new in biology, chemistry, and physics. While I learned quite a bit I found myself growing more and more frustrated as the course progressed. Several times I wanted to just quit but kept hoping things would get better. Comments were made in lectures...\"As we saw in a/the previous module...\" about topics that had not been covered. Questions were asked on quizzes on concepts that were not covered or only briefly alluded to. This required much research outide of class to pass the quizzes. So, yes, I learned a lot, but I am glad that I didn't pay for a certificate and I wouldn't recommend this class unless one has a strong foundation in organic chemistry, cellular biology, microbiology, and biochemistry. The physics was covered adequately for what was used.",

        "review_text": "I'm afraid I abandoned this course after a couple of weeks because I was finding the balance between reading material and video content to be skewed towards the reading, with much of this not being discussed further in the lectures. I've done many online courses and I like them because of the lectures - if I wanted to read lots of stuff then I could choose a textbook.",

        "review_text": "I wouldn't call this an intermediary level course. It's really challenging, and a lot of background in molecular biology and chemistry is needed. At times, it seems a bit disorganized, almost as a random collection of experiments and techniques, and my frustration with the course continually grew by the week 5. Weeks 5 and 6 are more dynamic, and this is where some previous course material starts to show up again, making the entire picture somewhat clearer.\nLecturers are good, and the production quality is on high-level. Subtitles can be improved, though. Many words (especially scientific terms) are incorrectly transcribed, almost as if they were automatically-generated. Explanations are great, but very condensed, so i recommend watching lectures several times.\nQuizes are difficult, sometimes to the point where they seem unfair. Most of the questions demand problem-solving skills. That's fine, and i do appreciate that, but maybe some easier exercises would be beneficial. I heard about T-REX and G-REX techniques for the first time ever, and immediately i was asked to solve problems related to them. It was unnecessarily frustrating.\nOverall, it is clear that a lot of effort was put into this course. It's done in the most professional way, with lots of examples, and awesome lecturers. Just the fact that it exists, and that it's the only course on chemical biology available on Coursera makes it worth it. However, it suffers from the same problem as the other course offered by the University of Geneva that i've taken so far: it needs to be didactically adapted. This is why i decided to give it four stars. I'm all up for a good challenge, but this one was a little too frustrating.",

But that\u2019s one of the benefits of moocs: you can take a class that\u2019s a little beyond your grasp, take away as much as you can, and save the rest as aspirational motivation. For my purposes, it was a great success.\nI spent 51 hours on site rather than the 21 hours predicted, but some of that is because of an obsession with note-taking. And I passed, though I probably didn't deserve to purely on the basis of knowledge retained (good test-taking skills, that obsessive note-taking, and a lot of persistence paid off).\n\nFMI I posted about the course on my personal website: \n\nhttps://sloopie72.wordpress.com/2021/03/08/switching-it-up-instead-of-biochem-lets-try-chemical-biology-mooc/",

Indeed so immensely privileged and grateful to have found this opportunity to learn the foundations of my dream research domain, online from some of the best Professors and Researchers from Universit\ufffd\ufffd de Gen\ufffd\ufffdve, EPFL (\u00c9cole polytechnique f\u00e9d\u00e9rale de Lausanne), etc., imparting education so magnificently, through practical and theoretical content, so well provided on this platform! I admit putting in a lot of effort behind completing this but with more and more euphoria and interest every time, in contrary to ideas of chilled and laidback vibes of general online courses with very flexible schedules. I am also immensely thankful to Coursera and my Alma Mater Indian Institute of Technology, Kanpur for providing us with such platforms to continue learning and never stop aiming high, even through these extremely challenging times. It indeed felt like one-to-one mentoring, thanks to Prof. Robbie Loewith and Prof Marcus J. C. Long. Elated and excited for more learning! Chemical Biology <3",
